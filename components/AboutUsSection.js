          Welcome to Melbourne West Driving School. Hi, my name is Waseem. I became a driving instructor in 2018 as it is something that I am passionate about. It's not often that you get to combine your work with something you enjoy and for that I am grateful.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 text-left">
          I am dedicated to teaching the next generation of drivers, helping them to understand the road rules and to be safe on the roads. I believe that it is important to be well equipped for any situation which may arise, good vision, early decision making and vehicle handling are all important contributors to minimising risks whilst driving.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 text-left">
          I aim to provide the information and training required to maintain safety for a lifetime. I provide a calm and friendly learning environment to ensure you are able to focus on your driving. I use a variety of teaching methods to ensure that I cater for you as the learner, doing my best to keep it simple, clear and easy to understand. At Melbourne West Driving School, we have both male and female instructors available to ensure every learner feels comfortable and supported.
